## Car Dashboards

## Pros & Cons of Current Designs
- Good
  - Designs that provide a number indicator for MPH simplify a users experience rather than reading a gauge. 
  - Having both a fuel and engine temperature gauge are necessary to avoid user complications.

- Bad
  - Overlapping gauges can over-complicate user experience.
  - Imbedded menu options require the user to spend too much time navigating
  - When gauges are related, like RPM and MPH, but are separated it adds unnecessary time to view the dashboard.

## Dashboard Design

## Interactive Features on Dashboard
    - Turn signals arrows activate when the driver pulls the lane changer lever
    - Bright lights indicator activates when the driver activates the bright light lever
    - Warning lights turn on when a specific issue arises with the car
    - The user can also activate cruise control or their parking brake


## Interactive Features on LCD Display
    - Touch Screen:
      -  A settings app will provide the users to customize their stereo and clock
      -  A maps app will give the user directions to a specific location
      -  A music app allows the user to play music from a connected phone
      -  A car app displays messages from the dashboard, like warning signals, on the car’s LCD display

    - Buttons:
      - Dials allow the change of volume from the car’s stereo
      - Dials allow the change of temperature in the car
      - Air flow buttons can allow the user to change the circulation and levels of air flow


## User Feedback
    - User feedback through:
      - Warning lights through the dashboard and notifications through the LCD display.
      - Lane changing blinkers through the dashboard
      - Map details through the LCD display
      - MPH and RPM displays from the dashboard
      - Fuel and temperature levels
      - Music and settings through the LCD display
